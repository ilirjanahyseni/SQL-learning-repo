# MySQL How to

MacOS:

1. Download MySQL: [macOS](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) (x86, 64-bit), DMG Archive	8.0.34	124.2M
   - Set a password for the MySQL root user. This is an important security step. The root user in MySQL has full access to all databases and tables, so it's crucial to choose a strong, secure password.

3. Download [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/) separately, (x86, 64-bit), DMG Archive	8.0.34	124.2M	
   - Use the same MySQL root user password.
